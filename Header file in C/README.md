# Understanding Header Files

## What are header files?
- Header files act as guides for our code, providing essential information for the computer to understand.

## What do they contain?
- They contain declarations for functions, variables, and structures we use in our programs.

## Why are they important?
- Header files help the computer interpret our code correctly and prevent errors.

## Some header file Examples

- **stdio.h**: This header file stands for "standard input-output header". It contains declarations for functions like `printf()`, `scanf()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, and file operations like `fopen()`, `fclose()`, etc.

- **stdlib.h**: This header file stands for "standard library". It contains declarations for functions like memory allocation and deallocation (`malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()`), pseudo-random number generation (`rand()`, `srand()`), and other utility functions.

- **math.h**: This header file provides declarations for mathematical functions such as `sin()`, `cos()`, `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `abs()`, etc.

- **string.h**: This header file provides declarations for string manipulation functions such as `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, `strlen()`, `strcmp()`, `strncpy()`, etc.

- **stdbool.h**: This header file defines a Boolean data type in C with true and false constants. It is particularly useful in programs where boolean logic is needed.

- **time.h**: This header file provides declarations for functions related to date and time manipulation, including `time()`, `ctime()`, `gmtime()`, `localtime()`, etc.
